The title of my soundscape is Come Over For Dinner. It starts with an invitation to a friend over the phone to come over for dinner and then the cooking and preparations ensue with a little trouble along the way. I really enjoy cooking and having people over is one of the things I miss the most in this pandemic and so my hope is that my soundscape can simulate the sounds of the makings of great night with friends.
